# Rules for setting up a group class:
# A group element is always stored as a 1D vector, even if the elements consist
# only of a scalar (in which case the element is a list of length 1). Here we
# also assume that you can parameterize your group with a set of n parameters,
# with n the dimension of the group. The group elements are thus always lists of
# length n.
#
# This file requires the definition of the base/normal sub-group R^n and the
# sub-group H. Together they will define G = R^n \rtimes H.
#
# In order to derive G (it's product and inverse) we need for the group H to be
# known the group product, inverse and left action on R^n.
#
# Finally we need a way to sample the group. Therefore also a function "grid" is
# defined which samples the group as uniform as possible given a specified
# number of elements N. Not all groups allow a uniform sampling given an
# aribitrary N, in which case the sampling can be made approximately uniform by
# maximizing the distance between all sampled elements in H (e.g. via a
# repulsion model).
